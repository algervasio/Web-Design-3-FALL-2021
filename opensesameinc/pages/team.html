          <p>I've always been somebody with an appreciation for design, art, and any sort of aesthetically pleasing visual. As a kid, I loved to draw. When I got my first family computer, I was obsessed with the idea of creating digital art. As I got older, I taught myself (thank you University of Youtube!) how to use adobe applications. From there, I dipped my toes in web design. My main profession is graphic design, but I've always loved learning and I hope to continue learning with my teammates here at Open Sesame. </p>

          <p>I got into web development at a very young age. I've always been interested in computers and how they work. For the most part, I'm self taught. I've done some schooling in web development just to further my education. Apart from web development, I love doing ceramics. I started in high school and I've continued into my adult life as a hobby.</p>

          <p>I went to Cal Poly SLO to learn UX/UI Design practices. I love connecting with people while doing my research. I guess you could say I'm a big people person. I also love doing DIY projects with any sort of scraps I have laying around the house. I'm a team player and I love having the opportunity to connect with others whenever the chance arises.</p>

          <p>I've always been told that I have really solid team leader/team management skills, ever since I was a kiddo. I love being able to help guide people to where they need to be. Staying organized is one of my top priorities because it helps me stay focused. I've literally been making detailed lists since I could write. My other passions include reading and social justice. I always have a book on me and I try to give back to people in need whenever I  can.</p>
